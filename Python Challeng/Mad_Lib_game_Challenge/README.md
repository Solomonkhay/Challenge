You got it! Let's stick to the basics and have some fun with  prompt ,  alert ,  var , and  console.log . Here's a challenge:

 *Create a simple "Mad Libs" game:* 

📍 *Prompt for words* : Use  prompt()  to ask the user for the following words:
An adjective
A noun
A verb
Another noun
A number
📍 *Store the words* : Use  var  to store each word in a separate variable.
📍 *Construct a story* :  Create a short story using the words the user provided. You can use  console.log()  to print the story to the console.
📍 *Display the story* :  Use  alert()  to display the completed story to the user.
