Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and Johm. compared their BMIs, Let's now implement the same funtionality with objects and methods
- For each of them, create an object with properties for their fullname, mass, and height
- Then add a method to each object to calculate the BMI to the object and also return it from the method
- in the end log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI, don't forget they might have the same BMI
- Remember  BMI =mass/height^2
