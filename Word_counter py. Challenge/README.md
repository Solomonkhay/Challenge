*Python challenge for the day*  📍 No Chatgpt 📌

You're making great progress!  Let's put your  print()  and  len()  skills to the test with a fun exercise:

 *Exercise: The "Word Counter"* 

📍 *Input a Sentence* : Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence.
📍 *Count the Words* : Use the  len()  function to count the number of words in the sentence. Remember, words are separated by spaces.
📍 *Display the Count* : Print the total number of words in the sentence.

Example:

 
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
word_count = len(sentence.split())  # Use split() to separate words
print("The sentence has", word_count, "words.")
 

 *Challenge:* 

Can you modify your program to display the length of the longest word in the sentence?

I'm excited to see what you come up with! Show me your code, and I'll be happy to provide feedback.
